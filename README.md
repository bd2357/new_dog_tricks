## Idea
I have been programming in C, mostly for embedded systems, for quite a while now. It is not my first computer language, but is the first I fully felt comfortable using and has become the language I think in for algorithms.  Recently I have been required to use Python extensively for a project while also coding embedded C, often the need to do the same algorithm in both languages.  This has for me been an eye opening experience.  When I am working in Python I often wish for the more rigid structure of C and when I am in C long for the simplicity of doing certain things (dictionaries and iterators) that Python just does.  Going forward, I wanted to have a place to write down some of my Ah Ha moments.
